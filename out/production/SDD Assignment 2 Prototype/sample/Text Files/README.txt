Each text file will consist of lines, which contain the word, followed by a space, followed by either a true, false, or 'both', which points to whether or not the word is a plural, or is refering to a plural. Multiple words can be counted as 1 entry by using an underscore, so the sentence class will replace underscores with spaces when formatting the sentence. Past tense verbs only. Any words that end in a vowel but sounds like it ends in a consonant e.g. "The" and "Some" and not "a" should also be placed in "endInConsonantSound.txt" so the program does not count them as ending with a vowel.
